## 🚀 What I Made

This project was made by me as a fun way to learn how to build a task manager from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I wanted to keep it minimal but still useful.

You can:
- Add a task with a priority like Low, Medium, or High.
- Delete any task using its name.
- Filter tasks to see only the ones you care about (like High priority).
- It also saves your tasks using **localStorage** so they don’t disappear when you refresh!

- **Dark mode** – I chose a clean dark theme because it's easier on the eyes.
- **Simple data structures** – Used data structure like array to make this website
- **Deployed with Vercel** – So anyone can try it instantly!
